# Botwiki.org and **Botmakers.org** Code of Conduct

## Introduction


This **Code of Conduct** applies equally to **every member of the Botwiki.org team and contributors and Botmakers.org community members** and in **all online and offline spaces** (examples include, but are not limited to, **private and public communication** in the **Botmakers.org** Slack group, emails, Twitter DMs, in-person contact, etc).

This is a **living document** and will be amended as necessary. Any updates will be immediately communicated on the **#announcements** channel in the **Botmakers.org** Slack group.

If you are **being [harassed](#what-is-considered-harassment)** by any member of the **Botwiki.org** or **Botmakers.org** communities, **notice that someone else is being [harassed](#what-is-considered-harassment)**, or have **any other concerns**, please contact the administrators by typing `/admin <your message>` in Slack, or contact an admin directly via DM.

***Note: Currently @stefan/[@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) is the only administrator; this list will be updated.***

If you are being [harassed](#what-is-considered-harassment) by a member of the **Botwiki.org** and **Botmakers.org** communities outside of our online spaces, we still want to know about it.

The admins reserve the right to exclude people from the **Botwiki.org** and **Botmakers.org** communities based on their past behavior, including behavior outside the **Botwiki.org** and **Botmakers.org** communities spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the **Botwiki.org** and **Botmakers.org** communities.

We will **respect confidentiality requests** for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may **publicly name** a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or **privately warn third parties** about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of members of the **Botwiki.org** and **Botmakers.org** communities or the general public. We will **not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent**.

## Code of Conduct

- **Be kind, respectful and considerate to others.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is **no excuse** for poor behaviour and poor manners.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Remember that **sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes** can be offensive to those around you.  Do not **insult or put down** other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior **aren't acceptable**. See the [What is considered harassment?](#what-is-considered-harassment) section below.
- It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views **constructively**. Being **unable** to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.
- This **Code Of Conduct** also applies to **all of your bot creations** -- do not use them to harass, hurt, demean others.

***An extra note on bots: We are a community of people who make "useful, interesting, artistic and friendly online bots". If you are going to create spammy, shady, scammy bots to gain traffic to your site, game the system of some other website, etc, this is not the right community for you.***

By contributing to **Botwiki.org** and participating in the **Botmakers.org** community you agree to this **Code of Conduct**. Make sure you **read it and understand thoroughly**.  Participants asked to stop any [harassing behavior](#what-is-considered-harassment) are expected to comply **immediately**.

If a participant engages in [harassing behavior](#what-is-considered-harassment), the **Botwiki.org** team and **Botmakers.org** administrators may take **any action they deem appropriate**, up to and including **expulsion** from all the **Botwiki.org** and **Botmakers.org** community spaces and identification of the participant as a **harasser** to other community members and/or the general public.

## What is considered harassment? 
  - Offensive comments related to **gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, religion, or other identity marker**. This includes **anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness**.
  - Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s **lifestyle choices and practices**, including those related to **food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment**.
  - **Deliberate misgendering**
  - Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour
  - Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
  - **Threats of violence**
  - **Incitement of violence** towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
  - **Deliberate intimidation**
  - **Stalking or following**
  - Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
  - Sustained disruption of discussion
  - **Unwelcome sexual attention**
  - Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
  - **Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease**
  - Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
  - Publication of non-harassing private communication
  - Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically. See [this article](http://www.racialicious.com/2012/05/02/a-historical-guide-to-hipster-racism/) for background.
