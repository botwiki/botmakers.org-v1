# Botwiki.org and Botmakers.org Code of Conduct

## Introduction


This **Code of Conduct** applies equally to every member of the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) team and contributors and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community members and in all online and offline spaces (examples include, but are not limited to, private and public communication in the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) Slack group, emails, Twitter DMs, in-person contact, etc).

This is a living document and will be amended as necessary. Any updates will be immediately communicated on the **#announcements** channel in the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) Slack group. You can also view [the history of changes](https://github.com/botwiki/botmakers.org/commits/master/Code%20of%20Conduct.md). 

If you are being [harassed](#what-is-considered-harassment) by any member of the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) or [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) communities, notice that someone else is being [harassed](#what-is-considered-harassment), or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators via DM.

***Note: Currently @stefan/[@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) is the only administrator; this list will be updated.***

If you are being [harassed](#what-is-considered-harassment) by a member of the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) communities outside of our online spaces, we still want to know about it.

The admins reserve the right to exclude people from the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) communities based on their past behavior, including behavior outside the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) communities spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) communities.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of members of the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) communities or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Code of Conduct

- **Be kind, respectful and considerate to others.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is **no excuse** for poor behaviour and poor manners.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Remember that **sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes** can be offensive to those around you.  Do not **insult or put down** other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior **aren't acceptable**. See the [What is considered harassment?](#what-is-considered-harassment) section below.
- It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views **constructively**. Being **unable** to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.
- This **Code Of Conduct** also applies to **all of your bot creations** -- do not use them to harass, hurt, demean others.

***An extra note on bots: We are a community of people who make "useful, interesting, artistic and friendly online bots". If you are going to create spammy, shady, scammy bots to gain traffic to your site, game the system of some other website, etc, this is not the right community for you.*** 

**¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**

By contributing to [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and participating in the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community you agree to this **Code of Conduct**. Make sure you **read it and understand thoroughly**.  Participants asked to stop any [harassing behavior](#what-is-considered-harassment) are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in [harassing behavior](#what-is-considered-harassment), the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) team and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all the [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other community members and/or the general public.

Lastly, we are a community for sharing ideas. If someone comes up with something interesting, ask if you can join their project rather than "stealing" the idea for yourself. It's just a nice thing to do.

If you do need some ideas to work on, have a look at the [Bot Summit 2014 document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bka4o1RE9RPUeoUzgpTIKRWsgWHzZEKEADialnv7haQ/edit?pli=1) or browse the [#botIDEA](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23botIDEA) hashtag on Twitter. 


## What is considered harassment? 
  - Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration status, religion, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.
  - Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
  - Deliberate misgendering
  - Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour
  - Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
  - Threats of violence
  - Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
  - Deliberate intimidation
  - Stalking or following
  - Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
  - Sustained disruption of discussion
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
  - Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
  - Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
  - Publication of non-harassing private communication
  - Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically. See [this article](http://www.racialicious.com/2012/05/02/a-historical-guide-to-hipster-racism/) for background. 

## Language and communication

One of the main goals of [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) is to create a safe online space where everyone is welcome. Making this happen will require effort from everyone participating in our project and our community.

There will be some technical tools put in place that will make this easier -- our Slack bot will be trained to recognize offensive language and privately notify the person who probably just didn't know they were using terms that others find offensive. Until then, I'd like to ask everyone to read about ableist language, with some great resources being:

 - [Doing Social Justice: 10 Reasons to Give Up Ableist Language](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rachel-cohenrottenberg/doing-social-justice-thou_b_5476271.html)
 - [List of disability-related terms with negative connotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disability-related_terms_with_negative_connotations)
 - [Alternatives to using ableist slurs](http://isthisableism.tumblr.com/sluralternatives)

*(More links coming soon.)*

If you see anyone using terms you find offensive or you believe would be offensive to certain groups of people, try reaching out to the person privately. The person probably meant no offense and public shaming -- or worse, attacks -- will not solve anything.

I also suggest to update the message using more appropriate language.

Also, be **very careful** about misunderstandings. These may happen particularly when all the nuances of communication, like body language or tone of voice are stripped away, like in an online setting. Also, remember that we are a group of people from all over the world, so people whose first language is not English will very likely learn about ableist language as a brand new concept.

**Always contact the person you feel is being offensive** and try to talk it out, **then contact the moderator**, if necessary.


***Personal note:***

This stuff is *hard* and there are some gray areas, so if you have any questions, ask in the [#code-of-conduct](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/code-of-conduct/) channel.

Our general rule of thumb for identifying slurs is that slurs are basically words/expressions that describe things people can't change about themselves while actually meaning "bad".

Again, any questions -- visit the [#code-of-conduct](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/code-of-conduct/) channel.
