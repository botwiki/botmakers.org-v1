# Bots on Botmakers.org

On top of a few people testing their bots, we have the following integrations:

## Dopewars Bot

[dopewarsbot.com](https://dopewarsbot.com): *Make a fortune dealing drugs on the streets of new york... on Slack.*

## slack-pokemon

[![slack-pokemon](https://botwiki.org/content/bots/slackbots/images/slack-pokemon.png)](https://botwiki.org/bots/slackbots/slack-pokemon/)

A Slack-based Pokemon game that lets you battle against a bot. I changed the keyword to `Pokemon`, so, for example, to start a game you'd type something like `Pokemon, battle me!`. (Also note that punctuation will be ignored.)

See the list of commands [on the original GitHub page](https://github.com/rvinluan/slack-pokemon/#how-to-play).

It would be really nice to turn this into a real game, for example, give people who join the [#games-pokemon](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/games-pokemon/details/) channel three random Pokemons, let players battle each other and win/lose Pokemons.

Anything's possible on Slack :-)

## slack-meme

Add memes to Slack with ease.

## slack-tableflip

[![slack-tableflip](https://botwiki.org/content/bots/slackbots/images/slack-tableflip.png)](https://botwiki.org/bots/slackbots/slack-tableflip/)

See screenshot above. You can use this bot in any channel -- with a reasonable frequency.

## MeMoji

[![MeMoji](https://botwiki.org/content/bots/slackbots/images/MeMoji.png?)](https://botwiki.org/bots/slackbots/MeMoji/)

A sort of "charades with emoji" game. There is a dedicated channel [#games-memoji](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/games-memoji/details/).

The original idea behind MeMoji was to have people create their own games (using `/memoji create {phrase} {emoji list}`), but there's a few built-in phrases. You can start a new game with `/memoji start` (after a game is over, you will have to start a new game again) and then make your guess with `/memoji guess {phrase}`.

For more commands see [memoji.mod.bz](https://memoji.mod.bz/).

## @botwikibot/Sidekick

[![Sidekick](http://getyoursidekick.org/images/reaction-retweet.png)](http://getyoursidekick.org/)

And of course, our very own **@botwikibot**/[Sidekick](http://getyoursidekick.org/). It's still a very early work in progress, but it can say *hello* and helps monitor our [#twitter-firehose](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/twitter-firehose/details/) channel.

## Notes

We also have the **Food** and **Startups** emoji packs from [emojipacks.com](http://www.emojipacks.com/).
